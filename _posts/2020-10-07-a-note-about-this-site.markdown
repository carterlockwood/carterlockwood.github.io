### **Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How?**

My name is Carter Lockwood and I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at the University of Alabama set for a May 2021 graduation. In May 2019, I received my undergraduate degree in Management Information Systems also from the University of Alabama. Since May 2019, I have worked as a Web Development Associate for Radiance Technologies in Huntsville, AL. I began working part time on call and moved back to Tuscaloosa in August 2020 so that I could pursue my graduate degree.

This is my first attempt at building a personal outlet to showcase my work and other ideas. As of October 2020, the site is currently built using Jekyll 4.1.1 and hosted with Github Pages. I chose these tools because of development simplicity and cost (NONE!). At the moment the site is using the most basic theme, *Minima*, that is included by default with Jekyll. 

In hopefully the next few months or so, I'm planning on switching over to a more advanced theme that'll look better and include more organizational features. My goal with this site is to create a place where I can organize things that I'm working on in a way that showcases my personal skills, but also helps to solidify the concepts I'm learning through class and life in general.
